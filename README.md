# PRASAC---Combodia-Bank
Demo code and documentation representing my work integrating image and signature upload features into the FLEXCUBE banking platform for PRASAC Microfinance.

I led the Java development team to integrate image and signature upload features into the FLEXCUBE 12.3.0.0 core banking platform. This improved customer onboarding and document management by enabling secure and efficient uploads.

Due to the confidential nature of banking software, this repository contains **demo sample code** and documentation to showcase the core concepts and technologies I worked with.
